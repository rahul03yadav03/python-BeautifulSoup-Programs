# PYTHON WEB SECURITY PRACTICE – Web Scraping & Security Analysis Using Python

- This project contains simple Python programs created to practice basic web security and web scraping concepts using Python.
- It is designed for beginners and undergraduate students who want to understand how websites work and how publicly available information can be analyzed programmatically.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

- This project was created as part of my cybersecurity learning journey.  I wanted to better understand how websites work internally and how  security-related information can be analyzed using Python. 

- Through this project, I explored web scraping, form analysis,  internal link crawling, and basic security inspection techniques.


# OBJECTIVES

- Learn how websites are structured (HTML basics)
- Understand how HTTP requests work
- Practice extracting data using BeautifulSoup
- Analyze web pages for security-related information
- Understand internal link crawling logic
- Learn how hidden fields and CSRF tokens work
- Practice safe and ethical security testing concepts

# TASKS IMPLEMENTED

- Extract unique domains from anchor (<a>) tags
- Find login input fields from forms
- Extract meta tags from web pages
- Scrape JavaScript file URLs
- Extract URLs or emails from HTML comments
- Detect admin/login URLs from sitemap pages
- Extract CSRF tokens from forms
- Identify hidden form fields
- Detect sensitive image filenames using keyword filtering
- Build a crawler that follows internal links only



# REQUIREMENTS

- Python 3.x
- requests module
- BeautifulSoup4
- urllib.parse (built-in)
  - Works on:
    - Windows
    - Linux
    - macOS

# INSTALLATION

- Install required libraries using:
   - pip install requests beautifulsoup4



# HOW TO RUN

- Open VS Code
- Open the project folder
- Open any .py file
- Open terminal in VS Code
- Shortcut: `Ctrl + ``
     - Run the program:
        - python file_name.py
      
# FLOWCHART / ALGORITHM

- A flowchart was created to represent the overall algorithm and workflow of the project.

- The flowchart image was generated using AI tools, but the idea, logic, and overall algorithm design were fully conceptualized and structured by me.



# LEARNING LEVEL

- Beginner to Intermediate
- Suitable for undergraduate students
- Good foundation for web security and cybersecurity basics
- Helps understand how reconnaissance and data extraction work
